# Open Responses

> Open Responses is an open, vendor-neutral specification for large language model APIs that defines a shared schema, consistent streaming/events, and extensible tooling to enable interoperable LLM workflows across different providers.

## Core Concepts

- Items are the fundamental unit of context in Open Responses: they represent an atomic unit of model output, tool invocation, or reasoning state
- Agentic loops: Unified streaming, tool invocation, and message orchestration
- Semantic events, not raw text or object deltas
- State machines, that is, they can live in one of a finite number of states, such as in_progress , completed , or failed
- Multi-provider, interoperable LLM interfaces based on the OpenAI Responses API
